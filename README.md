Webpack Skeleton

> A webpack starting point for both "legacy" code + react / ES2015 transpilation

A sample webpack configuration covering my following needs:
* multiple entry points: if you want to generate multiple js files as output
* common bundle (aka "vendor" bundle): a js bundle that contains all common junks from your entry points
* ES2015 transpilation
* react and jsx support
* sass compilation
* bootstrap css, font awesome, jquery
* Demonstration of using "legacy" code mixed with react components

Build with:

`npm run build`

Dev-build / watch with:

`npm run watch`
`npm run dev-build`
